It is mrwellness.ca policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.<br><br>Website Visitors<br>Like most website operators, mrwellness.ca collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.&nbsp;<br><br>Aggregated Statistics<br>Mrwellness.ca may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Mrwellness.ca However, mrwellness.ca does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.<br><br>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<br>Mrwellness.ca discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on mrwellness.ca behalf or to provide services available at mrwellness.ca websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.&nbsp; Mrwellness.ca will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, mrwellness.ca discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when mrwellness.ca believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of mrwellness.ca, third parties or the public at large.

Mrwellness.ca visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using mrwellness.ca websites, with the drawback that certain features of mrwellness.ca websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.<br><br>Business Transfers<br>If mrwellness.ca, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that mrwellness.ca goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be destroyed.<br><br>Privacy Policy Changes<br>Although most changes are likely to be minor, mrwellness.ca may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in mrwellness.ca sole discretion.
